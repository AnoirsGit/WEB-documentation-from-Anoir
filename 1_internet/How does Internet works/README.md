# How does internet works

## What is the internet?

The internet is the world's most popular computer network. The internet is for decentralization. No one owns internet or connects to it. Thousand of different organizations operate their own network.

## Where is the Internet?

**Data centres** are rooms full of servers that store user data nad hos online apps and content.  
**The backbone** [consist of long-distance networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O2Ezw992VA) - mostly on fiber optic cables that carry data between data centres and consumers.

## What's an IP address?

Internet Protocol addresses are numbers that computers use to identify each other on the internet.

## What is IPv6

Internet engineers have developed a new standard called IPv6 allows for n mind-boggling number of unique addresses — the exact figure is 39 digits long — ensuring that the world will never again run out.

## What is the cloud?

By storing files on servers and delivering software over the internet, cloud computing provides users with a simpler, more reliable computing experience. Cloud computing allows consumers and businesses to treat computing as a utility, leaving the technical details to technology companies.

## What is a packet?

A packet is the basic unit of information transmitted over the internet.Splitting up int small, digestible pieces allows the network capacity to be used more efficiently.

A packet has two parts:
the **Header** contains info that helps the packet get to its destination, including the length of the packet. its source and destination, and checksum val that helps recipient detect if a packet was damaged in transit. packet can contain **64kB**

## What is the World Wide Web?

The World Wide Web is a popular way to publish info on the internet. The web was created by **Timothy Berners-Lee**, a programmer at the research organization **CERN**. The web supported hyperlinks, allowing users to browse from one document to another.

In 1994, Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web consortium (W3C) to be the web's official standards organization. He is still the W3C’s director and continues to oversee the development of web standards. However, the web is an open platform, and the W3C can’t compel anyone to adopt its recommendations. In practice, the organizations with the most influence over the web are Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Mozilla, the companies that produce the leading web browsers. Any technologies adopted by these four become de facto web standards.

## What's a web browse?

A web browser is a computer program that allows users to download and view websites. Web browsers are available for desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones.

## What is SSL?

SSL, short for Secure Sockets Layer, is a family of encryption technologies that allows web users to protect the privacy of information they transmit over the internet.

Under the hood SSL accomplishes that by transforming your data into a coded message that only the recipient knows how th decipher. If a malicious party is listening to the conversation, it will only see a seemingly random string of characters, not the contents

## What is DNS?

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the reason you can access Vox by typing vox.com into your browser rather than a hard-to-remember numeric address such as 216.146.46.10.

The system is hierarchical. For example, the .com domain is administered by a company called Verisign. Verisign assigns sub-domains like google.com and vox.com. Owners of these second-level domains, in turn, can create sub-domains such as mail.google.com and maps.google.com.

Because popular websites use domain names to identify themselves to the public, the security of DNS has become an increasing concern. Criminals and government spies alike have sought to compromise DNS in order to impersonate popular websites such as facebook.com and gmail.com and intercept their private communications. A standard called [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions) seeks to beef up DNS security with encryption, but few people have adopted it.

## Who decides what domain names exist and who gets them?

The domain name system is administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a non-profit organization based in California. ICANN was founded in 1998. It was granted authority over DNS by the US Commerce Department, though it has increasingly asserted its independence from the US governmen
