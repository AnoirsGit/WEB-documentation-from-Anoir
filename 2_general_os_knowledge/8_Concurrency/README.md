# Concurrency
Concurrency in programming refers to the ability of a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, seemingly overlapping in time. It allows different parts of a program to make progress independently and concurrently, rather than executing tasks sequentially one after another.

Imagine a scenario where you have two friends, Alice and Bob, who both need your help with different tasks at the same time. Concurrency in programming is like being able to help both Alice and Bob simultaneously, switching back and forth between them as needed, so that they both make progress on their tasks without waiting for the other.

1) CPU Core: A core is a physical processing unit within a CPU (Central Processing Unit). Modern CPUs often have multiple cores, with each core capable of executing instructions independently. Having multiple cores allows a CPU to perform multiple tasks concurrently, which is known as parallel processing. For example, a quad-core CPU has four physical cores, and an octa-core CPU has eight physical cores.
2) Thread: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a program. It represents a single sequence of instructions that can be scheduled and executed by a CPU core. Threads are used to achieve concurrency within a program. A single core can execute multiple threads, and modern CPUs often support simultaneous multithreading (SMT) or hyper-threading, where each core can handle multiple threads concurrently.

In programming languages, concurrency is typically achieved using threads or processes. Here's a simple explanation of how it works:

1) Threads: Think of threads as small units of execution within a program. Just like having multiple friends to help you, a program can create multiple threads to handle different tasks concurrently. Each thread has its own flow of execution, allowing it to work independently of other threads. Threads can run simultaneously on multi-core processors or share CPU time on a single-core processor through time-slicing.
2) Processes: Processes are separate instances of a program that run independently. Each process has its own memory space, meaning they don't directly share data with other processes. Processes can work concurrently on different tasks, similar to threads.

Concurrency is useful in various scenarios, such as handling multiple user requests in a web server, parallelizing computations to speed up tasks, and managing background tasks while the main program remains responsive.

However, concurrency introduces new challenges, such as race conditions (when multiple threads or processes access shared data simultaneously, leading to unexpected results) and deadlocks (when two or more threads wait for each other to release resources, causing a program to freeze).

To handle these challenges, programming languages provide synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and atomic operations. These mechanisms ensure that shared resources are accessed in a controlled manner, preventing conflicts and maintaining consistency.
